# New architecture:

![architecture](../assets/architecture.png)

# RecallOS Ingestion Architecture Specification

## Goals

* Asynchronous ingestion
* Horizontal scalability
* Support PDFs, images, videos, audio, future modalities
* Retry-safe
* Re-embeddable without reparsing
* Fault tolerant using Redis Streams
* Easy to extend

---

# Components

## Storage

* **MinIO**

  * Stores uploaded assets.
  * Never stores parsed text.
  * Referenced by object key.

---

## Metadata DB (Postgres)

Stores

```ts
Document
--------
id
mimeType
objectKey
status
ownerId
createdAt
updatedAt
```

Future tables

```ts
ParsedChunkSet
--------------
id
documentId
modality
status
createdAt
```

```ts
ParsedChunk
-----------
id
chunkSetId
text
metadata(JSON)
```

---

# Upload Flow

```text
Frontend
    │
Upload
    │
MinIO
    │
confirm()
    │
HeadObject
    │
Document row
    │
XADD(files_stream)
```

Only the `docId` is pushed.

```json
{
  "docId": "..."
}
```

---

# Dispatcher

Consumes

```
files_stream
```

Responsibilities

* Read docId
* Fetch metadata
* Determine MIME type
* Route to correct stream
* ACK original message

Example

```
application/pdf

↓

pdf_stream
```

```
image/png

↓

image_stream
```

```
video/mp4

↓

video_stream
```

```
audio/mp3

↓

audio_stream
```

Dispatcher performs **no parsing**.

---

# Parser Workers

Each modality owns its own consumer group.

```
pdf_stream

↓

pdf consumer group
```

```
image_stream

↓

image consumer group
```

etc.

Responsibilities

* Download asset from MinIO
* Parse asset
* Generate ParsedChunkSet
* Store ParsedChunkSet
* Push chunkSetId onto embed_stream
* ACK original stream message

No embeddings happen here.

Workers are stateless and horizontally scalable.

# Failure Handling

Redis Streams automatically place delivered-but-unacked messages into the **Pending Entries List (PEL)**.

If a worker dies:

```
Job

↓

PEL
```

Healthy workers periodically execute

```
XAUTOCLAIM
```

to reclaim stale jobs.

If processing repeatedly fails after a configured retry limit:

```
Job

↓

Dead Letter Queue
```

A dedicated **DLQ worker** processes poisoned documents by either:

* successfully reprocessing them, or
* marking the document as `FAILED`.

If the DLQ worker also cannot recover the document, it remains in the DLQ for manual inspection.

# Design Principles

* Streams carry **IDs only**, never large payloads.
* Parsing and embedding are separate stages.
* Embedding workers are unaware of document modality.
* Every stage is independently scalable.
* Every stage can be retried independently.
* New modalities (PowerPoint, HTML, Git repositories, ZIPs, emails) only require a new parser that emits a `ParsedChunkSet`; the downstream embedding and indexing pipeline remains unchanged.
